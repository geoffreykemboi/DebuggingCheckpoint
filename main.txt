# Debugging Process

1. Setup

I used a sample React application with multiple components, state management, and props passing.  
The structure was like this:
```
App.js
 ┣━ Navbar.js
 ┣━ UserList.js
 ┗━ UserCard.js

2. Installation
I installed the React Developer Tools Chrome extension to inspect component tree and state.
✅ Installed and enabled

3. Issues Found and Solutions

| Issue | Description | Solution |
| Incorrect State Value | The showUsers state was always false after clicking the toggle button | I checked in DevTools and noticed setShowUsers was not updating correctly. Fixed the button click handler. |
| Missing Props | The UserCard component was receiving undefined values for user prop | In UserList.js, I was passing user={user.name} instead of user={user}. Fixed it. |
| Unexpected Behavior | User list was re-rendering unnecessarily | Used React.memo in UserList component to prevent unnecessary re-renders. |
| No Key in List | React DevTools showed a warning about missing key prop | I added key={user.id} in .map() function in UserList.js. |

4. Verification
After debugging:
✅ State updates correctly when toggling  
✅ Props passed correctly  
✅ No warnings or errors in DevTools  
✅ Application behavior is now smooth and expected
